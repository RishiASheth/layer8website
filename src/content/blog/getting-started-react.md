# Getting Started with React

React has become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. In this post, we'll explore why React is so popular and how you can get started.

## Why React?

React makes it easy to build interactive UIs with its component-based architecture. Here are some key benefits:

- **Reusable Components**: Build once, use everywhere
- **Virtual DOM**: Fast and efficient updates
- **Large Ecosystem**: Tons of libraries and tools
- **Great Community**: Easy to find help and resources

## Your First Component

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```
